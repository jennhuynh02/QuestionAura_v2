# QuestionAura_v2

A career-tribute rebuild of the original QuestionAura project, serving as both a learning journey and a demonstration of modern development practices with AI-assisted development.

## Project Intent

This is a learning-focused rebuild that emphasizes:
- Working with contemporary web technologies
- Exploring AI-assisted development workflows
- Building incrementally with modern best practices
- Intentionally kept minimal and evolving

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React** with **TypeScript** for type-safe, component-based UI development

### Backend  
- **Python** for server-side logic and API endpoints

### Database
- **SQL** database for structured data persistence

## Development Philosophy

This project is being built with significant AI assistance, exploring how AI tools can accelerate development while maintaining code quality and best practices. The repository is intentionally kept minimal and will evolve organically based on learning goals.

## Status

🚧 **Early Development** - Basic scaffolding only. Application logic, authentication, database schemas, and deployment configurations will be added incrementally as the project progresses.
