; This entire config file enables Alembic (the migration tool for SQLAlchemy) to run and log migrations for your project.
; A breakdown:
; - [alembic]: tells Alembic where migration scripts are and how to find your code.
;     - script_location: where to put/find migration files.
;     - prepend_sys_path: ensures local modules are found when Alembic runs.
;     - sqlalchemy.url: default DB URI; overridden by ALEMBIC env var or .env, but good as a fallback.
; - [loggers]/[handlers]/[formatters]: set up logging. This helps you see what Alembic and SQLAlchemy are doing. You get log output of migration steps, errors, and SQL.
; - [logger_root], [logger_sqlalchemy], [logger_alembic]: control log levels and output for SQLAlchemy and Alembic loggers.
; - [handler_console] and [formatter_generic]: log formatting so you get clean, readable logs in your terminal.

; Without these pieces:
;   - Alembic can't find your migrations or database info.
;   - Logging would be absent/ugly, which is problematic for debugging database changes.
;   - Your migration scripts wouldn't know how to connect to your dev DB.

; So you need it all for robust, debuggable migrations.
